Work in progress, more details on usage, installation, etc coming soon.

# Installing the package

With a current enough version of `pip` you can install directly from the repository with

```bash
pip install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite
```

Or with pipx (**recommended**) with

```bash
pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite
```
You might need to add `/home/YOU/.local/bin` to your `PATH` (like adding `PATH="/home/YOU/.local/bin:$PATH" at the end of your `.bashrc`, `.zshenv` or similar.

### Welcome to PiWrite!

**PiWrite** is a modal text editor inspired by Vim. If you want to know more details, please check the repository at `github.com/rberenguel/piwrite`

It partially supports a reduced subset of Markdown, so you can:

- Bold by surrounding with **
- Italics by surrounding with _
- Code block by surrounding with `
- Highlight a block by surrounding with :: (this is not markdown but was convenient)
- Use up to 4 # for headings
- Start a line with - to get an unordered list
- _Ordered lists are not supported_ 

---

### Changing modes

`i`: enter insert mode from normal mode just before the current cursor position
`I`: enter insert mode from normal mode _at the beginning of the current line_
`a`: enter insert mode from normal mode just _after_ the current cursor position
`A`: enter insert mode from normal mode _at the end of the current line_
`o`: add a line below the cursor and enter insert mode on it

`ESC`: enter normal mode from insert mode. For some reason (probably related to `prompt-toolkit` you need to press it twice. I'm looking into it.

### Commands that work regardless of the mode

`Ctrl-a`: move the cursor to the beginning of the paragraph/line
`Ctrl-e`: move the cursor to the end of the paragraph/line
`Ctrl-p`: run `proselint` in the current paragraph/line. It is a bit slow
`Arrows`: move the cursor around

### Commands in Normal mode

`gg`: Go to the beginning of the file
`G`: Go to the end of the file

`:h<enter>`: This help
`:e filename<enter>`: Open file (in the `piwrite-docs` folder only). Won't work if you have unsaved changes
`:e! filename<enter>`: Open file (in the `piwrite-docs` folder only). Will work regardless of your save state
`:w filename<enter>`: Write file (in the `piwrite-docs` folder only)

`u`: Undo. The default (and so far only) undo depth is 10
`Ctrl-r`: Redo. Same depth as above

`:rot`: Hacky, landscape mode. Cursor scrolling does not work that well in this case, sadly (due to browser issues I have to use the editor mode which is only half-functional)

`:mono`: Switch to a monospace font (Monoid)
`:sans`: Switch to a sans-serif font (Cooper Hewitt book)
`:serif`: Switch to a serif font (default, IM Fell English)
`:latex`: Switch to Computer Modern (the typical LaTeX font)

`:stats`: Get word/paragraph, Flesch-Kincaid readability and Flesch ease
`:lint`: Run `proselint` on the whole document. It is a bit slow to do so
`:dot`: Experimental: use a Graphviz header template in `dot_template.dot` and render this file. Press `q` to go back to the file
`v`: turn on "reading mode" for the current document

`:q<enter>`: Quit, will try to shutdown the machine. Won't work if you have unsaved changes
`:q!<enter>`: Quit, will try to shutdown th machine. Will work regardless of your save state

`:keys`: Insert the pressed keys in the buffer. Useful to debug

`dd`: delete the whole line
`daw`: delete _around_ word (will slightly alter spaces)
`diw`: delete _inside_ word (preserves spaces)
`caw`: change _around_ word (like daw but switches to insert mode)
`ciw`: change _around_ word (like diw but switches to insert mode)

`p`: paste the last deleted/copied text at the cursor position
`P`: paste the last deleted/copied text before the cursor position
